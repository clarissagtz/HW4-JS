## Changes made in my porfolio ##

- I added transition to my profile picture, now if you hover over my picture it zooms in a little. 
- I also addede two more pictures, the logos from the schools I went. (UCSD and SWC logos on the Education section) 
- Delete the "Tools" section I had before, I didn't really liked it. Now my page looks more clean and short. I am still thinking on delete or make 
another section shorter. 
- I changed the style of the titles form each of the sections, now they stand out more (in my perspective).
- On the contact section I add hover effect on the options of send me an email and visit my github. Change button colors and hover*
